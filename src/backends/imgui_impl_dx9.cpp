// dear imgui: Renderer Backend for DirectX9
// This needs to be used along with a Platform Backend (e.g. Win32)

// Implemented features:
//  [X] Renderer: User texture binding. Use 'LPDIRECT3DTEXTURE9' as ImTextureID. Read the FAQ about ImTextureID!
//  [X] Renderer: Multi-viewport support (multiple windows). Enable with 'io.ConfigFlags |= ImGuiConfigFlags_ViewportsEnable'.
//  [X] Renderer: Large meshes support (64k+ vertices) with 16-bit indices.

// You can use unmodified imgui_impl_* files in your project. See examples/ folder for examples of using this.
// Prefer including the entire imgui/ repository into your project (either as a copy or as a submodule), and only build the backends you need.
// If you are new to Dear ImGui, read documentation from the docs/ folder + read the top of imgui.cpp.

// CHANGELOG
// (minor and older changes stripped away, please see git history for details)
//  2022-XX-XX: Platform: Added support for multiple windows via the ImGuiPlatformIO interface.
//  2021-06-29: Reorganized backend to pull data from a single structure to facilitate usage with multiple-contexts (all g_XXXX access changed to bd->XXXX).
//  2021-06-25: DirectX9: Explicitly disable texture state stages after >= 1.
//  2021-05-19: DirectX9: Replaced direct access to ImDrawCmd::TextureId with a call to ImDrawCmd::GetTexID(). (will become a requirement)
//  2021-04-23: DirectX9: Explicitly setting up more graphics states to increase compatibility with unusual non-default states.
//  2021-03-18: DirectX9: Calling IDirect3DStateBlock9::Capture() after CreateStateBlock() as a workaround for state restoring issues (see #3857).
//  2021-03-03: DirectX9: Added support for IMGUI_USE_BGRA_PACKED_COLOR in user's imconfig file.
//  2021-02-18: DirectX9: Change blending equation to preserve alpha in output buffer.
//  2019-05-29: DirectX9: Added support for large mesh (64K+ vertices), enable IM_GUI_BACKEND_FLAGS_RENDERER_HAS_VTX_OFFSET flag.
//  2019-04-30: DirectX9: Added support for special ImDrawCallback_ResetRenderState callback to reset render state.
//  2019-03-29: Misc: Fixed erroneous assert in ImGui_ImplDX9_InvalidateDeviceObjects().
//  2019-01-16: Misc: Disabled fog before drawing UI's. Fixes issue #2288.
//  2018-11-30: Misc: Setting up io.BackendRendererName so it can be displayed in the About Window.
//  2018-06-08: Misc: Extracted imgui_impl_dx9.cpp/.h away from the old combined DX9+Win32 example.
//  2018-06-08: DirectX9: Use draw_data->DisplayPos and draw_data->DisplaySize to setup projection matrix and clipping rectangle.
//  2018-05-07: Render: Saving/restoring Transform because they don't seem to be included in the StateBlock. Setting shading mode to Gouraud.
//  2018-02-16: Misc: Obsoleted the io.RenderDrawListsFn callback and exposed ImGui_ImplDX9_RenderDrawData() in the .h file so you can call it yourself.
//  2018-02-06: Misc: Removed call to ImGui::shutdown() which is not available from 1.60 WIP, user needs to call CreateContext/DestroyContext themselves.
